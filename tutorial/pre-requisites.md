	- [SQL Server 2012 LocalDB](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062) and [SQL Server Data Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dn864412) 
	  should be automatically installed with Visual Studio. 
	 
* Northwind sample database; oldie but goodie.
    - Install the [SQL2000SampleDb.msi](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23654).
	- Open the `C:\SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases\instnwnd.sql` script in Visual Studio and execute it. 
	- Select the `(localdb)\v11.0` server when prompted to connect.
	- Verify that the database was created successfully in the `(localdb)\v11.0` server instance in the _SQL Server Object Explorer_.
